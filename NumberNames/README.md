# Number Names
Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a pre-existing implementation or make your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less)

## Extensions
1. Create support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).
